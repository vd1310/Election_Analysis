# Election Audit
# Election Results PyPoll Challenge
### Use Python to perform 'Election' audit
## Overview of Project
Analyze election results to determine voting analysis across counties and various candidates
### Purpose
The purpose of this challenge is to analyze election results using Python functions like for loops and conditional statements to find out winning counties and candidates along with winning numbers. 
## Objective: The election commission has requested following data to complete the election audit
#### 1. The voter turnout for each county
#### 2. The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count 
#### 3. The county with the highest turnout

## Results: 
###Please refer to PyPoll_Challenge.py, Resources and analysis folders in the git hub repository vd1310/Election_Analysis. (https://github.com/vd1310/Election_Analysis.git)
#### 1. How many votes were cast in this congressional election?
#####   Total of 369,711 votes were counted in this congressional election
#### 2. Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.

## Summary
### This Python script is a powerful tool to further analyze the election results. The script is well structured and easy to modify and thus can used for any election. Following are the examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections:
#### 1. We can create a conditional state for checking the year and then fetch that year's csv file to read data and provide results
#### 2. Incase of multiple years, the code can be modified to not only perform year specific election audit but also provide trend of votes and candidate's performance over the years
